# Power DI
## Introduction
![Power DI](https://i.imgur.com/dMMECKK.png "Power DI")
Power DI is a framework for collecting, transforming and displaying Darktide statistical data.

## Notable features
* Allows users to customize reports to their liking, or even create them from scratch, all from within the UI.
* Records events as source data, which means you can create new reports even after a mission is complete.
* While in a mission the auto save feature will periodically save all recorded data to disk, so in the event of a game crash you can continue recording where you left off.
* Records players gear and build, which allows you to inspect what a player was using during a specific session.
* API available for adding new data sources, datasets and report templates to Power DI.

## Core concepts
Power DI is build around the following three core concepts:
1. Data sources. Events are recorded to data sources, these data sources will usually only have the minimum needed data available, and are usually in a form that need additional transformations to make them readable.
2. Data sets. One more data sources can be combined to create a dataset. A dataset is a formatted table containing all the information needed to create reports.
3. Reports. A report is generated from a dataset, and creates a specific view of that data by displaying it in a structured way.

5. Edit report button. Press to edit the currently selected report.
6. Report columns. When the field type of the column is of type "player" the player names can be clicked on to view the gear and build that player used during that specific match.

8. Column. Drag and drop the desired field to be used as the column here. (Only one column can be selected)
9. Rows. Drag and drop the desired fields to be used as rows here. Rows can be ordered by drag and drop as well.
10. Values. Drag and drop the desired fields to be used as values here. Values can be ordered by drag and drop as well.
11. Expand value settings. Press to expand a value and show the settings for that value.
12. Label. Type in the desired label for the value.
13. Field/formula. Shows the field name for normal value. For a calculated value it will show the formula field, allowing you to enter the desired formula used for the calculated field. (See formulas section below for more information)
14. Format. Select the desired format for the value.
15. Visible. Select if the value should be visible in the final report. Useful in conjunction with calculated fields.
16. Add calculated field. Press to add a calculated field to the values list.
17. Data filter. Allows you to enter a formula used to filter the dataset. (See formulas section below for more information)
18. Pivot table settings. Currently unused, but will have setting specific to the pivot table report.
19. Exit Power DI. Press to close the UI.

## Report templates
The following report templates are available by default:
* Attack report
* Defense report
* Player abilities report
* Player blocked report
* Player buffs report
* Player interactions report
* Player slots report
* Player status report
* Player suppression report
* Tagging report

## Dataset templates
The following dataset templates are available by default:
* Attack reports
* Blocked attacks
* Player abilities
* Player buffs
* Player interactions
* Player status
* Player suppression
* Slots
* Tagging

## Formulas
Formulas are used for both the calculated fields and the data filter. Formulas use a simplified lua, and are run in a separate environment. For the calculated fields you have to compare to the labels of the values you entered. For the data filter you have to compare to the field names as shown in the dataset fields list.

Available symbols:
Symbol | Function
 --- | ---
`=`|equal
`~`|not equal
`>`|greater than
`<`|less than 
`or`|or
`and`|and
`(`|bracket open
