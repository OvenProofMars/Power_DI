On the top left you can select a session, this will load the data from disk and generate any reports from that data. Selecting sessions will be unavailable during missions

###Report list
On the bottom left you can select a report from the list to generate it based on the currently selected session data. On the right of the selected report there is a cog item to edit the report. At the bottom there is a "+" sign to start creating a new report from scratch.

The generated report will be displayed in the center. Any rows with a dot on the left can be expanded.
